===================
Main Requirements:
===================
------------
Introduction
------------
The Puppy Bowl is a mini-game that allows users to add and remove cute puppies to a game roster. Some of this application has already been finished,
but it is important to test "complete" functionality as well, to make sure everything is working for your clients.
---------
Main Page
---------
Should show a nicely formatted list of all players
Each player on the roster should be shown with two buttons:
A "See details" button that lets us view the details for that player. This should show at least:
The player's name, breed, and assigned team (or "unassigned" if they do not have a team)
A larger version of the picture
A button to go back to the main list
See the "Stretch Goals" section for more possible features
A "Remove" button that takes that player off the roster
----------------
Adding Player(s)
----------------
There should be a form on the page that allows us to add a new player.
The form should have at least two inputs and a button:
One input for the player name
One input for the player's breed
A submit button to send the data and add the player to the roster
See the "Stretch Goals" section for more possible form features.
When entering a name and breed into the form and then hitting "submit", the new player should pop up in the roster without a page refresh.
------------------
Removing Player(s)
------------------
When removing a player, they should disappear from the roster without a page refresh.
--------------
Stretch Goals
--------------
Stretch goals are features or functionality that are "nice to have" for an application, but not strict requirements. For the career simulation, 
consider them extra credit, but we should create test suites for them anyway.

Single Player View:
Show all of the teammates (all players assigned to the same team) as the current player.
Add a dropdown so that users can change the team assignment for the current player.
The team assignment should change in the single player view and in the roster immediately, without a page refresh.
Adding Players:
Add an input to the form which lets us provide an image URL when adding a player.
The linked image should show up as the player's portrait.

============
Test suits
